# 🏥 Hospital Admission Analysis

A **Power BI Desktop project** that analyzes hospital patient admission patterns to gain insights into healthcare operations and patient demographics.  
This project focuses on understanding key metrics such as **length of stay, ICU admissions, admission types, and patient demographics**, leveraging **data hierarchy** and **KPI visualization**.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The **Hospital Admission Analysis Dashboard** provides an interactive visualization of patient admission trends to help understand hospital performance metrics and patient care insights.

**Key highlights include:**
- Total admissions over time  
- Average and total **length of stay**  
- **ICU admission** distribution  
- Patient demographics (age, gender, rural/urban)  
- Admission types and trends by month and year

## 🧠 Core Concepts Focused

This Power BI project demonstrates the use of:
-  **Data Hierarchy** – Drill-down from Year → Month → Date for admission and discharge analysis  
-  **KPI Cards** – Key performance indicators for total admissions, average stay duration, and ICU occupancy  
-  **Data Modeling** – Relationship building between attributes (admission and discharge dates)  
-  **Data Cleaning** – Transforming raw hospital data into meaningful visuals
